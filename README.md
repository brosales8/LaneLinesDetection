# Finding Lane Lines on the Road
### Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree

**Author:** Bryan Rosales<br>
**Date:** May 31st, 2017

Overview
---

This is the first project for Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree. The objective is to develop a pipeline to detect correctly lane lines using images of camera located on the vehicle. The images are processed using computer vision techniques to finally draw 2 lines identifying the lane detected. For more detail of the project please see [Writeup.pdf](https://github.com/brosales8/LaneLinesDetection/blob/master/Writeup.pdf).
